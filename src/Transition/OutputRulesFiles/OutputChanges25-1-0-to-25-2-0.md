Output Changes
==============

This file documents the structural changes on the output of EnergyPlus that could affect interfaces, etc.

### Description

This will eventually become a more structured file, but currently it isn't clear what format is best. As an intermediate solution, and to allow the form to be formed organically, this plain text file is being used. Entries should be clearly delimited. It isn't expected that there will be but maybe a couple each release at most. Entries should also include some reference back to the repo. At least a PR number or whatever.

### System Summary table report, Demand Controlled Ventilation using Controller:MechanicalVentilation" Subtable
In the first column use ZoneName for zones with a simple DSOA reference (same as before), and use ZoneName:SpaceName for the spaces in a DSOA:SpaceList.

### EIO and HTML Table Output: Initialization Summary

A number of changes related to finding duplicated HTML tables (based on FullName) have been made.

See Pull Request [#11106](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/pull/11106).

#### Schedules

The `Output:Schedules` object controls whether the schedules are reported to the EIO, which would end up in the Initialization Summary report of the HTML if the `Output:Table:SummaryReports` asks for it.
The `Output:Schedules` object has a `Key Field` which can be either `Timestep` or `Hourly`, and it is **not** a unique object, meaning you can request **both**.

A few issues were occurring with the former EIO report (which is parsed to produce the HTML tables):

* The headers where not specific to a given `Key Field` (= Report Level), so if you requested both they would show in both reports in the HTML table
* The headers were NOT aligned with the data rows, so some tables were not present in the HTML (WeekSchedule, ScheduleTypeLimots=
* The `ScheduleTypeLimits` were issued in both `Timestep` and `Hourly` reports in the EIO

#### Warmup Convergence Information

When `Output:Diagnostics` has the `ReportDetailedWarmupConvergence` enabled, both the regular report and the detailed one were named `Warmup Convergence Information` resulting in duplicated HTML tables that would include lines from the other report.

The `ReportDetailedWarmupConvergence` report (the one that shows the status at each timestep/hour until convergence is reached) was renamed to `Warmup Convergence Information - Detailed`.

#### Material:Air

The `Output:Constructions` has two possible keys: `Materials` and `Constructions`. Both were adding a table named `Material:Air`. The Constructions one was renamed to `Material:Air CTF Summary` to match the surrounding tables.

#### Fuel Supply

When using `Generator:FuelSupply`, the header was written twice in the EIO Initialization Summary as `! <Fuel Supply>,...` leading to two identical tables in the HTML report.

### ThermalStorage:*:Stratified, ThermalStorage:ChilledWater:Mixed output variable name change

Change the follwing variable from "... Thermal Storage ..." to "... Thermal Storage Tank ..."

before change:
- Chilled/Hot Water Thermal Storage Temperature

### EIO and HTML Table Output Changes and New Tables

#### EIO and HTML Table Output - Schedule-Hourly/Schedule-Timestep

Change header to the EIO table to make more compatible with the parsing that the Initialization Summary so that columns for more
that the first Until Date/WeekSchedule are shown. Made explicit for the first 9 pairs of Until's. The use of 9 pairs of columns is preferred to a report that has a flexible number of columns.

Previous
```
! <Schedule - Hourly>,Name,ScheduleType,{Until Date,WeekSchedule}** Repeated until Dec 31
```

Changed
```
! <Schedule - Hourly>,Name,ScheduleType,Until Date 1,WeekSchedule 1,Until Date 2,WeekSchedule 2,Until Date 3,WeekSchedule 3,Until Date 4,WeekSchedule 4,Until Date 5,WeekSchedule 5,Until Date 6,WeekSchedule 6,Until Date 7,WeekSchedule 7,Until Date 8,WeekSchedule 8,Until Date 9,WeekSchedule 9,
```

#### EIO and HTML Table Output - Airflow Stats Nominal

The EIO tables related to Airflow Stats Nominal and the Initialization Summary which include:

- ZoneInfiltration Airflow Stats Nominal
- ZoneVentilation Airflow Stats Nominal
- Mixing Airflow Stats Nominal
- CrossMixing Airflow Stats Nominal

Have been updated to add the input object name. This was done to identify the type of algorithm used.

### Tabular Report output to eio
- Add a new field for "Format Reals" to the eio output for "Tabular Report".
- Fix unit conversion value when format is not HTML.
- Always report this to eio, even if table reports are not active.

Example before:
```

Tabular Report,HTML,NONE
```

New:
```
! <Tabular Report>,Style,Unit Conversion, Format Reals
Tabular Report,HTML,NONE,Yes
```

See pull request [#10209](https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/pull/10209)

### Table and eio Output Changes Related to Zone Multipliers

* eio "Zone Sizing Information" - The values for "Floor Area {m2}" and "# Occupants" are now reported with multipliers applied to be consistent with the other values reported for zone sizing.

* Outdoor Air Details table output has a new column for "Zone Multiplier".

* HVAC Sizing Summary table output values for "User Design Load per Area" have been corrected to properly account for zone multipliers.
