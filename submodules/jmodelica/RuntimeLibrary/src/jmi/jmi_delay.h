/** \file jmi_delay.h
    \brief Interface to simulation of delay and spatialDistribution blocks.

    Delay blocks are kept in the `jmi_t` struct and are indexed from 0 to `n_delays - 1`;
    spatialDistribution blocks are indexed from 0 to `n_spatialdists - 1`.
    Each block represents a use of the `delay` operator with fixed or variable time delay,
    or the `spatialDistribution` operator, respectively.
    The functions below that take an index operate on a single delay or spatialDistribution block,
    those that don't operate on all relevant blocks at once.

    The total number of delay and spatialDistribution blocks is specified upon model initialization,
    aftern which `jmi_delay_new` and `jmi_spatialdist_new` respectively is called on each block.
    Correspondingly, `jmi_delete` deallocates the blocks with the aid of `jmi_delay_delete` and
    `jmi_spatialdist_delete`.


    Delay blocks
    ------------
    Most functions need the current time value, which they take implicitly from the `jmi_t` struct.
    
    Before using a delay block in simulation, it must be initialized with `jmi_delay_init`.
    This will specify the properties of the delay block and provide an initial value for its output,
    to be used until the elapsed simulation time exceeds the delay time. If `fixed` is true, then 
    the fixed delay value must be passed as the max value.

    Delay blocks are evaluated using the `jmi_delay_evaluate`, which uses the current time and input
    value in cases when the delay time is small. `jmi_delay_evaluate` will step over events stored
    in the delay buffer if `jmi->atEvent` is true, and not otherwise.

    Delay blocks need to be fed with new samples of their input value regularly to save in the delay buffer.
    This is done with `jmi_delay_record_sample`, which should be called
      * after each completed integrator step (call `jmi_delay_set_event_mode` with `in_event` set to false first) and
      * after each completed event iteration (call `jmi_delay_set_event_mode` with `in_event` set to true first)
    The event mode set with `jmi_delay_set_event_mode` controls whether an event is considered to have occured
    just before the recorded sample. Time should increase from one sample to the next, except for recorded events,
    where the time should be the same as for the previous sample.
    
    Depending on their type, delay blocks can generate
      * no events (`no_event` set to true),
      * time events (`fixed` set to true), or
      * state events (`fixed` set to false)
    The caller must initialize the flags correctly when calling `jmi_delay_init`,
    and make sure to query event indicators precisely for the delay blocks with `fixed` and `noevent` set to false.
    Delay blocks that cause events will not be able to cross events in the delay history unless the events that
    they request are triggered.

    Time events are queried collectively for all delay blocks that cause time events using `jmi_delay_next_time_event`.

    Delay blocks with state events have two event indicators (forward and backward), both with a >= 0 relation,
    queried with `jmi_delay_first_event_indicator` and `jmi_delay_second_event_indicator`.


    spatialDistribution blocks
    --------------------------
    spatialDistribution blocks are quite similar to delay blocks, but there are some differences:
      * They cannot be fixed-delay, and can only trigger time events, not state events.
      * They are initialized with full contents for 0 <= x <= 1 using `jmi_spatialdist_init`.
      * The position `x` must be explicitly supplied to most functions.
      * They only use one event indicator, for the next event in the direction indicated by `positiveVelocity`.
